# Greetings, I'm Alessandro and I'm a Web Developer!

This is my portfolio website, showcasing my best projects, each project
has been created using React and I have a learned a lot about Web Development while building them.
I have updated my portfolio with these new projects after studying and practicing different tools on my own such as the aforementioned React, but also TypeScript, Tailwind, Redux, and much more!
